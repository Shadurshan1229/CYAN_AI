							<h2>Literature Survey</h2>
									<p>The existing research related to NPCs, Conversation in video games, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning in video games is reviewed in this literature survey. Common research about NPCs mostly focused on the physical behaviors of the NPCs such as NPC movement, daily routine, and combat abilities. In [1], Caroline M. Rose conducted similar research which proposes a solution to generate dialogue according to the players' replies using question answering, sentiment analysis, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and information extraction. This solution required the player to type the appropriate question using the expected keywords then the NPC AI can predict and answer the question. This solution was implemented inside Minecraft to demonstrate the functionality. Though this solution looks similar this still required the developers to create the scenarios so the player can type the question manually to get the answer. On the other hand, our solution does not need any human intervention except the initial keywords input, and our solution creates both question and answer, so the players don't have to manually insert a query to continue the conversation. This paper also proposes a new input method to improve the player controls and gives the player freedom to continue and create a conversation with the NPC.</p>
									<p>Research about real-time NPC behaviors using AI and ML proposed an understanding of how an NPC can be more human covering some of the fascinating facts that NPCs can make the game a more rich and more believable experience. This research paper called Flexible and Purposeful NPC Behaviors using Real-Time Genetic Control [2] uses the technologies like Bayesian networks and fuzzy logic to enhance NPC decision-making more robustly.
										According to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) Lecture from 2021, Generating Customized yet appropriate game world stories are achieved by some individuals by just using Open AI’s Natural Language Processing combined with Voice AI programs. This technology is still very new and not completely real-time making this technique non-usable for commercial uses. Open AI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text that can be used to generate a real-time conversation with NPC and Player. But this type of model is just an intelligent chatbot without any understanding or knowledge about the surrounding world.

									<h2>Research Problem</h2>
									<p>The problem is that in games, less prioritized NPCs do not have more than one or two dialogues which makes the conversations repetitive. Some NPCs do not have any dialogues to interact with, and dialogues that the NPCs say do not relate to the game world or plot. NPCs do not have a real-time dialogue system to generate unique dialogues on each conversation cycle. These are some of the major problems that modern large-scale games struggle with. We are mainly focusing on the NPCs that are not the main part of the story, but they are also a part of the game world. These NPCs will only have their routine tasks but after the proposed solution, the NPCs will have the capability of delivering a robust conversation with the player.
										To solve these problems and give the player freedom to have a conversation with every NPC, we must create a realistic conversation system that should be able to create a story that is related to the game world, generate well-branched dialogues with both input and output dialogues to create immersive conversation with any NPC in the game.
										</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
									<p>This project proposes an AI-powered conversation system that will generate a simple story from provided tag words and then process this story and create structured dialogues for both NPCs and the players, and then finally will import the dialogues into the game engine to use it inside the game. All the processes will be done through the cloud or locally outside the game engine to reduce the delay and performance costs. This advanced conversation system will reduce the development cost when creating dialogues for NPCs while providing unique and non-repetitive conversations between NPCs and players.
										</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Research Objectives</h2>
									<p>create a realistic conversation system to solve the problems in the existing conversation system in video games using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. Using Natural Language Processing and reinforcement learning the system will be able to make the conversations more realistic and believable. This conversation system should be able to work Unity game engine to make the process of creating an effective conversion system less complicated process.
